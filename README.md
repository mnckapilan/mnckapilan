### Hi there 👋🏾

I'm currently a software engineer at a london-based fintech, and I studied computing (ai + ml) @ imperial college london.

I enjoy working in diverse, multidisciplinary teams to solve challenging problems.

Find more on [kapilanm.com](https://kapilanm.com/) or get in touch with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kapilan-m/)!

_PS: my claim to fame is that I raised a teeny tiny PR for Simon Willison that he mentioned me for [in a blog post](https://simonwillison.net/2021/Sep/13/datasette-desktop-2/)_ 😄
